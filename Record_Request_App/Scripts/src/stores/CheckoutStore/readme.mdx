# Checkout Store

## Store

### This store is used to manage the functions, getters, and setters that pertain to the Cart List.
<Playground>
    <div>
        <p>
            Users will add an item to the cart (box or folder) and the added items will be displayed in the cart. If the cart has items in it, the submit button will be enabled, which, when pressed, will call for a submit cart form. This form will require user input to explain any special special requests. Submission of the form will submit the cart and request the items.
        </p>
    </div>

</Playground>

## Props Interface

<PropsTable of={CheckoutStore} />
