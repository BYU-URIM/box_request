# UI Store

## Store

### Message Bars, Forms, Dropdown Menu

---

This store is pretty straight forward. Here, functions involving the opening and closing of forms (and their types) can be accessed. 

There are also functions to call and kick out the message bar component used to notify users of success and failure. 

Information from the department object is converted into clear, concise options for the dropdown menu. The dropdown menu also has some customizeability depending on whether or not the user has access to more than one department.
