# Greeting

## Component

### This component is used to let the user know they are logged in.

<Playground>
    <div>
        <Greeting user={user}/>
    </div>
</Playground>

## Props Interface for Greeting

<PropsTable of={Greeting} /> 

The user property has the following attributes: 
- name
- username
- email
- Id
- departments.

You can play with this component by deleting "user" in the playground and replacing it with a variable like:

```javascript
testName = {name: "Jarod Smith"}
```

That will allow you to customize the displayed name (you can copy and paste that code and replace the user variable).
