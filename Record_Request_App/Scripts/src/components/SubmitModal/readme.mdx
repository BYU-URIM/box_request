# SubmitModal

## Component

### This component is used when the user is ready to checkout his/her items. It gives the user the opportunity to give special directions for their request.

<Playground>
    <SubmitModal
        submit={requestStore.submitRequest}
        modal={requestState.modal}
        requestForm={mockFolders[0]}
    />
</Playground>

## Disclaimer

You cannot give the requestForm property something like mockFolders[0].  You need to feed it an instance of the RequestForm class.

## Props Interface

<PropsTable of={SubmitModal} />
