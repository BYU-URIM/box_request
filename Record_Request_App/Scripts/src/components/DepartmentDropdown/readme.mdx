# DepartmentDropdown

## Component

### This component is used to select the user's department. Boxes that appear in the BoxList component depend on which department is selected.

<Playground>
    <div>
        <DepartmentDropdown
            handleChanged={ddP.handleChanged}
            options={[
                {
                    key: 45123,
                    text: "45123 - The Man Department"
                },
                {
                    key: 12345,
                    text: "12345 - The Woman Department"
                }
            ]}
            dropdownInfo={ddP.dropdownInfo}
            initializeBoxForm={ddP.initializeBoxForm}
        />
    </div>
</Playground>

## Department Dropdown Props Explained

You can easily see what the options must look like *(in our code for the actual application, we automated the process because we have a lot of departments and weren't going to hardcode them)*, and can even edit the names of the departments if you'd like! They'll change in the playground component. Changing the keys will break it in this example, though.

The following props are coded below. These can't be changed; they're more to give you an example of values you need to put into the handleChanged, dropdownInfo, and initializeBoxForm.

### ddP.handleChanged

---

```javascript
const departments:IDepartment[] = [
    {
        name: "The Man Department",
        id: 45123,
    },
    {
        name: "The Woman Department",
        id: 12345
    }
]

let selectedDep = {
    id: 45123
}

const handleChanged = (id) => {
    if (departments.find(_dep => _dep.id === id)) {
    selectedDep = id
    }
} 
```

handleChanged takes the id of the input *(the new department being selected)* and finds the same id in the array of available departments. When it finds that id, it sets that id to the new selected department.

### ddP.options

---

For the options, you just need an array of departments that have attributes of **name** and **id**.

### ddP.dropdownInfo

---

```javascript
let selectedDep = {
    id: 45123
}

function dropdownInfo(): IDropdownInfo {
    const info: IDropdownInfo = {
        title: "",
        key: selectedDep ? selectedDep.id : 0,
        placeHolder: "Departments",
    }
    info.title = selectedDep ? "Your Department:" : "Select a Department"

    return info
}
```

dropdownInfo is used to decide if the user has 1 or more available departments. If they have more than one department, then they're given a dropdown list. Otherwise, they get a simple header.

### ddP.initializeBoxForm

---

```javascript
const boxForm = () => (uiStore.form = FormTypes.NEW_BOX)
```

initializeBoxForm accesses the stores to open a form window where the user can request to create a new a box or boxes. The function needs to return an existing FormType.
