# WarningDialog

## Component

### This component is used when the user does something silly. It shows up if the user adds a folder and then the folder's box and recommends that they keep just the folder or remove the folder and add the box (the buttons are set up to do this for them). Or if they add 5 folders in a box, it recommends that they just add the box and leave the folders alone.

<Playground>
    <WarningDialog
        removeChildFolders={
            requestState.removeChildFolders
        }
        removeParentBox={requestState.removeParentBox}
        dialogMessage={"This is an example of a dialog message."}
    />
</Playground>

## Props Interface

<PropsTable of={WarningDialog} />
